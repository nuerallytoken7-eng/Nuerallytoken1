# How to Buy NUERALLY Tokens with USDT

This guide specifically details the process for purchasing NUERALLY tokens using **USDT (BEP-20)** on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network via MetaMask or Trust Wallet.

### 📋 Prerequisites (Before You Start)

Ensure your wallet meets the following two requirements. If you do not have both, the transaction will not work.

1.  **USDT Balance:** You must have the amount of USDT you wish to invest (Minimum **10 USDT**).
2.  **BNB Balance (Gas Fees):** You MUST have at least **$1.00 - $2.00 worth of BNB** (approx. 0.003 BNB) in your wallet to pay for network transaction fees.
    *   *Why?* Every action on the blockchain (Approving and Buying) costs a small fee paid in BNB. You cannot pay this fee with USDT.

### ❓ Troubleshooting

*   **Button stuck on "Processing..."**: check your wallet's "Activity" tab. You may have a pending transaction that needs confirmation.
*   **"Insufficient Funds" Error**: This almost always means you have **0 BNB** or not enough BNB for gas fees. Deposit $2 worth of BNB and try again.
*   **Mobile Issues**: Ensure you are using the browser **built into** MetaMask/Trust Wallet, not your phone's default browser.
